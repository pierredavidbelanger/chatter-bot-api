# Chatbot Meets Chatbot

Chatbot meets chatbot is a fun little idea I thought of in class and made in Java. You can have two chatbots talk for a specified amount of replies and start with a specified string. It supports [Cleverbot](http://www.cleverbot.com/), [JabberWacky](http://jabberwacky.com/) and [Pandorabots](http://www.pandorabots.com/).

Most of this code was forked and was made by [pierredavidbelanger](https://github.com/pierredavidbelanger).
